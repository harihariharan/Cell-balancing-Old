    <h3>Introduction</h3> 
    <p>In recent years lithium-ion batteries have been used for various applications such as locomotion, power supply etc. So, there is a high demand for lithium-ion batteries. The energy of an individual Li-ion cell is very low so it cannot be used. To overcome this many cells are connected in series and parallel as a battery pack to achieve the desired power requirement. However, the problem with Li-ion batteries is the unbalanced voltage and charge of the individual cell in the battery pack which may lead to the inefficient usage of the batteries. To avoid this there are various solutions. One of them is known as the active cell balancing method. In this method, the energy from the cells with high voltage is distributed among the cells with low voltage or State-of charge. This process is repeated until all the cells in the battery pack are balanced with similar state-of-charge. Many types of active cell balancing are possible. Such as inductor-based, capacitor-based, and converter-based. Among these, each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The converter-based active cell balancing seems to be the most efficient among those. In this research, we have used a flyback current-fed Ćuk converter had been used for the balancing the cells. The flyback section of the converter provides isolation for the cell and the Ćuk part is used for distributing the energy among the cells without fluctuation.</p>
